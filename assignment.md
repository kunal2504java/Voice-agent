Imagine an AI voice that calls each Riverwood customer every morning, speaks like a friend, remembers
 yesterday’s conversation, and delivers personalized construction updates.
 “Namaste Sir, aaj aapne chai pi?” 
“Kal bola tha weekend visit karne wale the — kaisa raha experience?”
 The goal isn’t automation — it’s bond building. The AI should remember every detail and make each
 conversation warm and natural.
